Hello and welcome to my Github depository!

I'm Marco, a positive and open-minded professional who works in the field of Environmental Engineering, with a focus on data and innovation. I had the amazing opportunity to work and study abroad in multi-cultural environments, demonstrating strong initiative and self-motivation. With years of experience in R&D and project management, I have excellent communication and written skills. Iâ€™m always eager to jump into new professional projects.
